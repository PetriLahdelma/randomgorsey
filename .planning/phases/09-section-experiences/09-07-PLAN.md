<objective>
Polish and verify the complete section experiences transformation, testing cross-page navigation and mobile experience.

Purpose: Ensure all pages work together as a cohesive whole while maintaining distinct personalities. This is the quality gate before phase completion.
Output: Polished section experiences with verified mobile support and cross-page choreography.

  <name>Task 1: Clean up deprecated code and CSS Module dependencies</name>
  <files>src/pages/Home.tsx, src/pages/Gallery.tsx, src/pages/Listen.tsx, src/pages/About.tsx, src/pages/Contact.tsx, src/pages/Discography.tsx</files>
  <action>
Review each page file and clean up:

1. **Remove unused imports**:
   - `isWebMSupported` (no longer needed with VideoBackground)
   - Any CSS Module imports for styles that were converted to Tailwind
   - Any unused component imports

2. **Verify all inline styles are converted**:
   - Search for `style={{` in page files
   - Convert remaining inline styles to Tailwind classes
   - Exception: iframe attributes like `frameBorder` should remain

3. **Ensure consistent import structure**:
```tsx
// External
import React from 'react';

// Internal - motion
import { motion, xxxVariants } from '@/lib/motion';

// Internal - components
import { VideoBackground } from '@/components/effects';
import { KineticText } from '@/components/KineticText';
import { Container } from '@/components/layout/Container';
import { Stack } from '@/components/layout/Stack';
import RevealOnScroll from '../components/RevealOnScroll';

// Assets
import video from '../videos/xxx.webm';
```

4. **Verify data-section attributes**:
   - Home: `data-section="hero"`
   - Gallery: `data-section="gallery"`
   - Listen: `data-section="listen"`
   - About: `data-section="about"`
   - Contact: `data-section="contact"`
   - Discography: `data-section="discography"`

5. **Run linting and fix issues**:
```bash
npm run lint -- --fix
```
  </action>
  <verify>
1. No `isWebMSupported` imports remain in page files
2. Minimal inline styles (only where necessary)
3. `npm run lint` passes
4. `npm run ts:check:types` passes
  </verify>
  <done>All pages cleaned of deprecated code, consistent import structure, lint passes</done>

  <name>Task 2: Verify cross-page transition choreography</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Test page transitions by running the dev server and navigating:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Manual testing checklist:
1. **Home -> Gallery**: Dramatic exit, gentle enter
2. **Gallery -> Listen**: Gentle exit, slow immersive enter
3. **Listen -> About**: Slow exit, warm natural enter
4. **About -> Contact**: Warm exit, crisp enter
5. **Contact -> Discography**: Crisp exit, catalog reveal enter
6. **Discography -> Home**: Catalog exit, dramatic re-enter

Verify:
- Exit animations complete before enter begins (AnimatePresence mode='wait')
- No flash of content at wrong position
- Scroll resets to top on navigation
- No janky transitions or overlapping animations

If issues found, adjust timing in section-variants.ts or AnimatedRoutes.tsx.
  </action>
  <verify>All 6 page transitions feel choreographed and intentional</verify>
  <done>Cross-page navigation verified - exits complete, enters begin, scroll resets</done>

  <what-built>
Complete section experiences transformation:
- 6 pages with distinct visual personalities
- VideoBackground tier-aware on all pages
- KineticText headlines
- Section-specific motion variants
- Layout primitives (Container, Stack)
- Stagger animations where appropriate
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:5173

3. **Test each page personality:**
   - Home: Does the headline animate dramatically? Do posts stagger?
   - Gallery: Does it feel light and airy? Do images cascade?
   - Listen: Does it feel slow and immersive? Is music the focus?
   - About: Does it feel warm and personal? Do cards have hover?
   - Contact: Does it feel crisp and professional?
   - Discography: Do albums reveal like a catalog?

4. **Test cross-page navigation:**
   - Navigate between all pages
   - Verify transitions feel choreographed, not jarring
   - Verify scroll resets on each navigation

5. **Test mobile (Chrome DevTools device mode or real device):**
   - Toggle device toolbar (Cmd+Shift+M)
   - Select iPhone or Pixel
   - Navigate through all pages
   - Verify: Poster images show (not video), animations work, touch scroll smooth

6. **Test reduced motion:**
   - System Preferences > Accessibility > Display > Reduce motion
   - Refresh the site
   - Verify: Animations are minimal/disabled

7. **Final assessment:**
   - Would a design-literate peer say this is "intentionally designed"?
   - Does each page feel like a different room in the same building?

- [ ] All pages cleaned of deprecated code
- [ ] No unused imports
- [ ] Consistent import structure across pages
- [ ] All data-section attributes present

<success_criteria>
The site transformation is complete when:
1. Each page has a distinct personality that matches its content type
2. Pages feel like different rooms in the same building (cohesive but distinct)
3. Mobile gets full personality experience (poster images, same animations)
4. A design-literate peer would describe the site as "intentionally designed" not "assembled from templates"
</success_criteria>
