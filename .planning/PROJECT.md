# Random Gorsey

## What This Is

A personal creative website that serves as a design playground and experimental frontend lab. Not a client project. Not constrained by conservative UX rules. A place to push creative boundaries, try bold ideas, and ship something that feels intentionally designed and ahead of the curve.

## Core Value

**Ship something you'd be proud to show design-literate peers** — every decision should feel intentional, not safe.

## Requirements

### Validated

<!-- Existing capabilities from current codebase -->

- ✓ React 19 SPA with client-side routing — existing
- ✓ 7 pages (Home, About, Contact, Gallery, Discography, Listen, 404) — existing
- ✓ Contact form with validation and email sending — existing
- ✓ Framer Motion animation infrastructure — existing
- ✓ SEO with react-helmet-async and static generation — existing
- ✓ Component library with CSS Modules — existing
- ✓ Storybook for component development — existing
- ✓ TypeScript throughout — existing

### Active

<!-- Design overhaul — transforming from functional to expressive -->

- [ ] Strong typographic hierarchy — editorial, expressive, confident type system
- [ ] Intentional motion design — micro-interactions, transitions, scroll behaviors that serve the experience
- [ ] Distinct section personalities — each section has its own character, not a homogeneous blur
- [ ] Large type-driven layouts — confident use of scale and whitespace
- [ ] Purposeful hover and focus states — interactions that feel crafted, not default
- [ ] Scroll-based reveals — tasteful, not gimmicky
- [ ] Clear visual identity — strong enough to be recognizable, not generic minimalism
- [ ] Confident copy throughout — no lorem ipsum, no marketing fluff, creative lab tone
- [ ] Modern grid with intentional breaks — structure with personality

### Out of Scope

- WebGL/shader/canvas effects — complexity vs. value tradeoff; maybe v2
- Mobile app framing — web-first
- Lighthouse score maxing — performance matters but isn't the lens
- Enterprise UX patterns — this is explicitly not that
- Startup clichés — no hero illustrations, no "we're passionate about", no bento grids
- Client-safe decisions — allowed to be bold

## Context

**What exists:** A functional React 19 SPA with 18+ components, solid animation infrastructure via Framer Motion, CSS Modules for styling, and a working deployment to GitHub Pages. The foundation is technically competent but aesthetically generic.

**What's changing:** Design and interaction direction. The infrastructure stays. The personality transforms.

**Mental model:** Creative developer portfolio + experimental design lab + cultural moodboard. "What happens if I actually try things instead of playing safe?"

**Audience:** Design-literate. People who notice when something is intentionally designed versus assembled from templates.

**Trends allowed if they serve the concept:**
- Large type-driven layouts
- Kinetic typography
- Modern grid systems with intentional breaks
- Bold color moments or controlled monochrome with accents
- Purposeful hover/focus states
- Tasteful scroll-based reveals

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: React 19, TypeScript, Framer Motion, CSS Modules — existing infrastructure
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages static deployment — existing
- **Performance**: Must remain usable; not a Lighthouse exercise but can't be sluggish
- **Content**: Invent reasonable placeholder content where needed; no lorem ipsum

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Design overhaul, not rebuild | Solid technical foundation exists; the problem is aesthetic, not architectural | — Pending |
| Editorial typography direction | Strong type hierarchy is the fastest path to "intentionally designed" | — Pending |
| Motion as personality, not decoration | Framer Motion is already there; use it to create character, not just transitions | — Pending |
